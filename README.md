**SAP DataHub:** 


The implementation in this repository shows a simple interaction with Apache Kafka. The graph consists of two subgraphs. The first subgraph generates some data and writes the data into a Kafka message queue, while the second subgraph reads the data from Kafka, converts it to string and prints the data to a terminal.

This repository contains some demo and practise implementations of technologies offered by SAP.
Pipeline uploads in this repository were built on SAP data hub dev edition, using SAP Data Hub Modeler, running on Docker.
These are strictly for trial and for the purpose of learning.
